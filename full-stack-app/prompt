Generate a full stack application using python flask for the backend, javascript/html/css for the frontend, and sqlite3 for the database.
The frontend of the application should display a separate widget for each column in the example .csv file below.
The frontend should have a submit button that when pressed sends the values of the textboxes, dropdowns, etc to the backend REST API endpoint.
The backend should hash the values and if the hash value is odd return "transported" to the frontend, otherwise return "safe".
The backend should store in a table in sqlite the values provided by the frontend in a separate column for each value, the computed hash in a column, and whether they were transported in a column.
The frontend should display a picture of a person being transported if "transported" is returned, otherwise display a picture of a person who safe.
